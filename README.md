# RAHBIN — Build Governance

This repository is used as a **code/build/evidence layer** for the RAHBIN project.

## Authority order

1. Google Sheet CURRENT — product decisions, frozen scope, pricing, design contract, source alignment.
2. ClickUp — execution status, owners, task progress.
3. GitHub — code, branches, pull requests, build manifests, test evidence and release artifacts.

GitHub must **never override** the CURRENT Google Sheet.

## Current baseline

- Architecture: `RAHBIN-ARCH-V2.4.9-r2`
- Frozen implementation release: `RAHBIN-W1-FREEZE-2026-08-29`
- Active implementation build: `RAHBIN-W1-BUILD-0.1.0`

## Scope change classification

Every change must be classified as exactly one of:

- `W1-P0 Fix`
- `W1-P1 Polish`
- `W2 Candidate`
- `Rejected / Duplicate`

No feature may enter Wave 1 without the formal frozen-scope exception path.

## Mandatory traceability

Every implementation PR must include:

- Decision ID(s)
- Workstream ID
- ClickUp task ID
- Change classification
- Acceptance gate(s)
- Test evidence / regression impact
- Explicit statement that no pricing/scope/product decision was invented in GitHub

## Security note

This repository is currently public. Do **not** commit proprietary pricing tables, credentials, customer data, private RBAC details, secrets, private source documents or confidential Sheet exports here. Product truth remains in the private authoritative source.
